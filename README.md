# Agent-based-Simulation-Grouping-Behaviors
The main purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to use your linked list within the context of an agent-based simulation.  In this week's simulation, we will have Agents that are on a 2D landscape. They will have positions in a continuous (floating point) 2D space, rather than the grid from the Game of Life. Like in the Game of Life, the agents are active and will implement an updateState method.  For this simulation, we won't have the concept of a scale factor, or you can think of the scale factor as being 1 so that coordinates map to pixels. If your Landscape's size is 500 by 500, then the Agents' positions should be between 0 and 500.  The Agent-based simulations were inspired by Growing Artificial Societies by Epstein and Axtell, two of the first researchers to make use computational modeling to examine social science questions about self-organizing societies.
